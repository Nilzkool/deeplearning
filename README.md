# deeplearning
Hello,

This is a self written deep learning repository to gain a better understanding of deep learning. The first library is called a 
L_layer_NN which  is a set of functions to implement a L layered neural network with options of L2 and dropout regularization. 
The formulations of forward prop and backward prop are taken from the notes of Andrew Ng's awesome deeplearning course
