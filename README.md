# deeplearning
Hello,

This is a self written deep learning repository to gain a better understanding of deep learning. The first library is called a 
L_layer_NN which  is a set of functions to implement a L layered neural network with options of L2 and dropout regularization.  Additionally, it also supports verification of the back propagation gradients against numerically computed gradients of
the cost function. The formulations of the matrices have been taken from the notes of Andrew Ng's awesome deeplearning course (https://www.deeplearning.ai/). I have also included a python script on how to use the library L_layer_NN using a toy dataset. 
I will keep on updating this library with additional features.
